In the advancement of smart cities, intelligent and sustainable infrastructure is vital for ensuring cleanliness, safety, and efficiency in urban environments. The Smart Manhole Monitoring System and Trash Collection project offers an IoT-based solution to monitor and manage underground drainage systems in real time. Utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller, the system integrates tilt, ultrasonic, temperature, gas, and obstacle detection sensors to collect and transmit live data. A solar-powered servo motor mechanism filters and collects trash from flowing water, depositing it into an inbuilt pit or bin, preventing blockages and maintaining smooth water flow while promoting energy efficiency. A standout feature is the application of data science techniques to analyze sensor data, producing daily detailed reports via Google Sheets or Excel. These reports identify triggered threshold values, support historical analysis, and offer insights for timely maintenance or future upgrades. Instant notifications are sent to authorities when abnormal conditions are detected, enabling swift intervention and hazard prevention. By reducing manual inspections, protecting sanitation workers, and ensuring effective trash filtration, this system significantly enhances smarter, safer, and cleaner urban drainage management. Future improvements could focus on enhancing sensor durability and scalability across diverse urban settings.*
